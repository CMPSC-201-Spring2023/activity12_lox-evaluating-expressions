# Activity 12: Lox Evaluating Expressions

## DUE: March 3 by 2:30pm

## Introduction

This activity invites students to follow [Chapter 7 of the "Crafting Interpreters" textbook](https://craftinginterpreters.com/evaluating-expressions.html) to get their interpreter to evaluate expressions and to complete a baseline implementation of the interpreter. You are to work in the lox team you have already set up previously.

You are responsible for storing all implementation for this activity in your team's `lox_interpreter` repository. This activity will be assessed through individual team member commits.
